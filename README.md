The Railway Reservation System serves as an advanced platform enabling passengers to inquire
about train availability based on their specified source and destination, facilitating the seamless
booking of tickets. This project is designed to create and manage a comprehensive database
containing records of diverse trains, their statuses, and passenger details. By automating the
reservation process, the system ensures error-free, secure, reliable, and swift seat management.

Online reservation functionality has revolutionized the seat reservation process, offering
unprecedented convenience to users. The Railway Reservation System efficiently keeps track of
bookings, freeing users to focus on other activities. The project's administrator has the capability
to input new train details, view all existing train records, make modifications to train
information, and remove outdated train records.

Each train record encompasses essential details such as its name, number, departure and arrival
stations, schedule, available seats, and fare. This system streamlines the entire reservation
process, enhancing user experience and contributing to a more efficient and organized railway
management system.
